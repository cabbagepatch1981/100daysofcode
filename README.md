# 100 Days Of Code Journal / School of Code Bootcamp Journal
## Day 1
---
_Date_Saturday 18th March

### **Todays Progress:**
- JavaScript Functions.  After a the first week at School of Code, this morning was revision of functions in JS with a group from the course.  
- Developing task planning and notating skills.
- Talking through the code line by line.

### **Thoughts:**
- Can't believe how much the Bootcamp has taught us in the first week and the difference between now and the first day of the course.
